# Weather-Api-App

# Introduction:
Hey folks, in this project My aim was to fetch weather data from [Weather Bit API](https://www.weatherbit.io/api) and the Flag of the country (of the state entered by user) from [Country Flag API](https://countryflagsapi.com/) by using the `country_code` from the Weather Bit API Response.

## Please See:
Excuse me for the Design of the application, because I haven't spent any amount of time for styling it. My **primary focus** was on implementing the logic of the app.   
***Even a small contribution related to the design part of the website would be highly appreciated!***
